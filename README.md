# Project-2-Part-1
A machine learning project I created for a school assignment. IT WILL NOT RUN UNLESS THE DATA IS PROVIDED. This is simply to used as a reference of work and quality of projects. 
I used SciKitLearn, Numpy, and Pandas Libraries to accomplish this. Using decision trees and logistic regression models, I acheived 94% accuracy on date classification.
